This project focused on analyzing mood-based fashion consumption patterns. 
I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify category-wise and mood-wise fashion trends.
I enhanced the dataset by creating a “Mood” column and validated data logic using test cases. Insights were presented through an interactive Excel dashboard, enabling easy visualization of trends and decision support.
The project highlights skills in data wrangling, analysis, dashboarding, and trend modeling.
